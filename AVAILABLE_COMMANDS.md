### help  
Description: If no arguments are specified, the command displays a list of all commands available in the current context. In order for a command to be displayed, it must be enabled in the guild (or global), and the user must have permission to use it. Passing the all argument will list all commands, regardless of context. Passing anything else will search for any commands that match, and display detailed information if only one is found.

_examples_
+   help
+   help eval
### ping  
Description: The ping command will send a message, then edit it to contain the amount of time it took. It also displays the client's heartbeat ping.

_examples_
+  ping
### prefix  
Description: This command, if not provided with any arguments, will display the current command prefix, and how to use commands. If the command is used in a guild channel and an argument is specified, it will set the command prefix for the guild if the user is a guild admin, or the bot owner, If the command is used in a DM and an argument is specified, it will set the global default command prefix if the user is the bot owner.

_examples_
+  prefix
+  prefix %
### eval  
Description: The eval command will allow the bot owner to evaluate any JavaScript code, and display its result. It will automatically hide the bot's token/email/password in the output. Caution should still be taken, however, as you could potentially break your running bot with it.

In the script, this will refer to the Command instance. There are several shortcut variables and helpers that are also available:

_examples_  

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| message, msg | Variable | The message that triggered the command |
| client | Variable | Shortcut to this.client |
| objects | Variable | Shortcut to this.client.registry.evalObjects |
| lastResult | Variable | Shortcut to this.lastResult (the previous eval result value) |
| doReply(val) | Function | Sends another detailed message with any value to display. Useful for callbacks. |  
### enable  
Description: Enables a command/group in the current guild if the user is an admin or the bot owner. If used in a DM, enables the command/group globally by default if the user is the bot owner.

_examples_
+  enable brick  
### disable  
Description: Disables a command/group in the current guild if the user is an admin or the bot owner. If used in a DM, disables the command/group globally by default if the user is the bot owner.

_examples_
+  disable brick  
### reload  
Description: Reloads a command, or all commands in a group, if the user is the bot owner.
