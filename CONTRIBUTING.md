> 7. This is your bot token. **Keep it secret**, as people who know it can take control of your bot.

## Prerequisites: Get your user ID

- The user id is a numerical [snowflake](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/reference#snowflakes) id used by the Discord API to identify who is responsible for maintaining the bot. [Follow these directions to get your user id](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).


## Prerequisites: Get an invitation link
